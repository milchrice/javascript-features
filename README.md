Project Name: Team Portfolio - JavaScript
Description:
Welcome to our team's JavaScript-powered portfolio project! In this project, we have implemented various fun and interactive features using pure JavaScript to enhance the user experience. Each team member took responsibility for one of the following features:

Parallax Effect
Our website features a stunning parallax effect that provides a sense of depth and immersion as users scroll through the content. The parallax effect is achieved through JavaScript, creating an engaging visual experience.

Timer
We have incorporated a countdown timer that starts from a specified time and counts down to 00:00:00. The timer also emits a beep sound when it reaches zero, adding a sense of urgency to time-sensitive activities.

Stopwatch
Our stopwatch functionality allows users to start counting up from 00:00:00 and stop it whenever they press a button or key. It is a useful tool for measuring elapsed time during various activities.

Map Points of Interest
Explore various points of interest on our interactive map! As users hover over the coordinates on the map, information about that specific location pops up, making it easy to discover interesting places.

Technologies Used:
HTML
CSS
JavaScript (pure JS, no external libraries)
Version Control:
We have utilized Git VCS for version control. Each team member created their branch (along with a remote) to work on their assigned feature.
